# Predict-Profit
In this project, I implemented a linear regression model based on some features such as marketing spend and some other features to predict the profits of the company, then I calculated a lot of mathematical calculations that help us evaluate the model that we created, and finally we calculated the accuracy (score) of the model, whether when training data or performing Testing on the model.
