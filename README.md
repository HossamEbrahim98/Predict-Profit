# Predict-Profit
In this project, at first I carried out some modification to the data using the Excel program, so I knew the duplicate values and deleted them, then I discovered null values and filled the cell when it was one in the row, and deleted the entire row if it had more than one null cell.
All of this is shown inside the Excel file "Before Editing" , and it is clear with steps and arrows how I did that, and then after the data became ready for use I implemented a linear regression model based on some features such as marketing spend and some other features to predict the profits of the company, then I calculated a lot of mathematical calculations that help us evaluate the model that we created, and finally we calculated the accuracy (score) of the model, whether when training data or performing Testing on the model.
